# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the general approach I want to follow:

Basically, the Tic Tac Toe can be represented by three arrays that represent the rows, each one with three columns.
Each time when one of the players click on the board I want to modify the arrays to capture their choice. At this time I want to validate their choices and print the messages to match the rules of the game. When this is completed I want to update the user interface.

I'm going to create the html file to display the basic design of the Tic Tac Toe game.


## How to handle player choice:
This game is going to have two buttons named "Player X" and "Player O". The first player that chooses a button initiates the game, and buttons get disable at this point.
