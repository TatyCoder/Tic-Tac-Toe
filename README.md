# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is the general approach I want to follow:

Basically, the Tic Tac Toe can be represented by 3 arrays that represent the rows, each one with 3 columns.
Each time when one of the players click on the board I want to modify the arrays to capture their choice. At this time I want to validate their choices and print the messages to match the rules of the game. When this is completed I want to update the user interface.

I'm going to create the html file to display the basic design of the Tic Tac Toe game.
